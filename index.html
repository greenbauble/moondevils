<h2>Morning, Day One</h2>
<img class="panel-full stone7" src="images/other/all-four.png" />
<div class="gutter-full">Streams of eerie purple light usher in a new day.  You gather your officers for a strategy session.</div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-concerned.png" /><span>We expect to escape this moon in four days, but unless we're proactive, we may not last that long.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/scientist-nervous.png"/><span>No kidding.  There's hundreds of other wrecks out there, and no record of this moon in our data banks.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-irked.png" /><span>Before we panic, let's assess our findings.  Priestess, what turned up on the sensor sweep?</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky3" src="images/conversations/priestess-neutral.png" /><span>We're surrounded by a ring of mountains and forests, too dense for our sensors to penetrate, but we did detect a sizable structure to the east.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky4" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-normal.png" /><span>A structure?  Like a base of operations?</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/priestess-impassive.png" /><span>I believe it's a temple of some sort.  Any sign of civilization could lead us to food and water.  Our <strong>health</strong> conditions are quite poor.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/martian-neutral.png" /><span>Even still, we must be very cautious in the field.  I've been exploring the forests, I don't believe we're alone on this moon.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky3" src="images/conversations/scientist-aghast.png" /><span>Great, that's just what we need.  Little moon men coming to eat us.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/martian-irked.png" /><span>You may not be far off.  I've been following the tracks of humanoid creatures, with teeth and claws.  I'm going to keep at it and try to boost our <strong>safety</strong>.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky4" src="images/conversations/scientist-irked.png" /><span>During the day is one thing, but what if they come for us at night?  We've got to improve our <strong>security</strong> around here.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/priestess-weirded.png" /><span>How do you propose we do that?</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky4" src="images/conversations/scientist-eager.png" /><span>By exploring the wrecks.  I can strip some of them for useful parts.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-peeved.png" /><span>There's also the question of <strong>energy</strong>.  We won't be able to power our equipment without it.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/martian-concerned.png" /><span>Seems to me we should rely on our wits and training.  Where is more energy even supposed to come from?</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-glib.png" /><span>From the Zolian ship.  The Valiant reports it crashed in the mountains.  With my scanner and blaster, I'll be able to elude them and steal their energy crystals.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/priestess-surprised.png" /><span>Be careful if you go up there.  We still don't know the Zolian's intentions, or their current capabilities.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-weary.png" /><span>You're right about that, and you all make good points.  I could also help you with your respective missions.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/martian-satisfied.png" /><span>Well, make up your mind.  I'm anxious to get out in the field.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="section" id="morning-meeting-2-all-alive">
<h2>Morning, Day Two</h2>
<div class="gutter-full">Visibly shaken from the night attack, your officers gather in a panic.</div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/scientist-aghast.png"/><span>OK.  As we can all plainly see, we are vulnerable at night.  We've got to head to the wrecks.  Improve <strong>security</strong>.  Make these night attacks less brutal.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-irked.png" /><span>Hang on now, last night's attack was troubling, but that's not all we have to worry about.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/priestess-argument.png" /><span>I agree.  Surely maintaining our <strong>health</strong> should be a primary concern as well.  I'm making real progress at the temple.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/martian-satisfied.png" /><span>As am I in the forest, improving our <strong>safety</strong>.  When I'm succesful, it betters the crew's odds of escaping attack and completing their tasks.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-peeved.png" /><span>And with an ample supply of <strong>energy</strong> it makes it easier for me to help you.  I'm afraid we're at an impasse.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/scientist-irked.png"/><span>Looks that way, but with these night attacks we can't cover all our bases for long.  We're going to have to figure out what's really important.</span></div>

<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/martian-angry.png" /><span>At least the devils are the enemy we know.  The Priestess is dead and we don't understand what even happened to her!</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-angry.png" /><span>We're not going to find out either.  The temple is stricly off limits.  It's too dangerous.  We'll have to rely on whatever remain health we have.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/martian-claws.png" /><span>All the more reason to improve <strong>safety</strong> for you two.  I'm going back to my forest patrols.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-defensive.png"/><span>Fine, I might seek out some more sources of energy, see if we can level the playing field.  Let's go people.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue-gutter"><span>Tough words, but your officers are looking pretty shaky.  The night attack was bad enough, but no one expected the Priestess to die like that.</span></div>
<div class="gutter-full">The image of her sickening smile burns in your memories.  What the hell is going on on this moon?</div>

<h2>Morning, Day Two</h2>
<div class="gutter-full">Visibly shaken from the night attack, your officers gather in a panic.</div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/priestess-surprised.png" /><span>That was terrible.  There must be some way we can improve the shuttle's <strong>security</strong>.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/scientist-wary.png"/><span>There are still plenty of parts I can harvest from the wrecks.  The more I can improve the shuttle, the better we'll be at deflecting the attacks.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/priestess-peeved.png" /><span>And what about the Martian?  She never came back.  What can we do to find her?</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-stunned.png"/><span>I .. uh .. wish we had the resources.  But the fact remains that if she didn't respond to our hails, she's probably dead.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/scientist-hurt.png"/><span>I gotta say I agree with the Lieutenant.  You've got to keep concentrating on the temple, boosting our <strong>health</strong>.</span></div>

<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-weary.png"/><span>But be careful out there.  Without her we have no way of making of the field safer.  It's only going to get more dangerous for both of you.</span></div>
<div class="gutter-full">As the meeting breaks up, your last statement really sinks in.  Without her, there's no way to improve their safety.  This could be last time you see either of one.</div>
<div class="gutter-full">It almost makes you wish you hadn't murdered her.</div>

<h2>Morning, Day Two</h2>
<div class="gutter-full">Visibly shaken from the night attack, your officers gather in a panic.</div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/priestess-surprised.png" /><span>That was terrible.  There must be some way we can improve the shuttle's <strong>security</strong>.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-defensive.png"/><span>I'm afraid not.  The only one who really knew about that was the Scientist, and he's ... missing.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky1" src="images/conversations/martian-claws.png" /><span>You don't seem at all concerned with tracking him down.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-stunned.png"/><span>I .. uh .. wish we had the resources.  But the fact remains that if he didn't respond to our hails, he's probably dead.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/priestess-impassive.png"/><span>I'm sad to say I agree with the Lieutenant.  I'm going to keep concentrating on improving our <strong>health</strong>.  If we can't stop the night attacks we can at least survive.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/martian-regal.png"/><span>I'm going to keep concentrating on <strong>safety</strong>.  The more devils I kill, the less chance we'll be attacked during the day.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/lieutenant-weary.png"/><span>I'd like to help you both out, although finding more <strong>energy</strong> would be helpful as well.</span></div>
<div class="dialogue"><img class="sky2" src="images/conversations/martian-irked.png"/><span>Perhaps that would be best.  You certainly weren't able to help the Scientist.</span></div>
<div class="gutter-full">You chalk up that remark to nerves and insubordination.  They couldn't possibly know that you killed him.</div>
<div class="gutter-full">It doesn't matter.  You're still alive and so are they.  You have to keep moving.</div>
</div>


<div class="section" id="morning-meeting-3">
<h2>Morning, Day Three</h2>
<div class="gutter-full">As you plan today's adventures, you assess your mission status so far.</div>
<img class="vanish panel stone7 health-low" src="images/priestess/neutral.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter health-low"><span>Despite's the Priestess' efforts you are in extremely poor health.  Maybe you should loan her a hand today.  You won't be able to command anyone if you're dead.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel stone7 health-medium" src="images/priestess/neutral.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter health-medium"><span>Thanks to the Priestess you are in relatively good health.  Maybe there's something to her theories about the temple.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel stone7 health-great" src="images/priestess/neutral.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter health-great"><span>Thanks to your combined efforts in the temple you're in great physical shape.  It might be time to take on some more challenging tasks in other areas.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel sky1 health-noway" src="images/temple/temple3.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter health-noway"><span>You always had a bad feeling about that temple, and with the Priestess gone, there's no point in going back.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel stone9 safety-low" src="images/martian/normal.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter safety-low"><span>There's a good chance any one of them could be injured or killed in the field.  You might want to follow the Martian and find out what's really going on out there.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel stone9 safety-medium" src="images/martian/normal.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter safety-medium"><span>There's always a chance someone will get attacked, but conditions seem to be improving.  Whatever she's up to you out there, you can't deny it's working.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel stone9 safety-great" src="images/martian/normal.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter safety-great"><span>Field safety conditions are optimal.  There's always a chance someone will get attacked.  But it's nice to know you've minimized the risk as much as possible.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel brush4 safety-noway" src="images/forest/forest2.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter safety-noway"><span>With the loss of the Martian, field operations are more dangerous than ever.  You might not want to risk anything to jeapordize safety further.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel stone8 security-low" src="images/scientist/arms-crossed.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter security-low"><span>These night attacks have been absolutely brutal.  If you don't help the Scientist improve security the next one could wipe you out.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel stone9 security-medium" src="images/scientist/arms-crossed.png"  />
<div class="vanish gutter security-medium"><span>The night attacks have been rough but manageable.  He may be difficult to deal with, but the Scientist's work has made the shuttle more secure.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel stone9 security-great" src="images/scientist/arms-crossed.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter security-great"><span>You can't stop the night attacks, but the Scientist's improvements have really taken the sting out of them.  You can finally concentrate on some other areas.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel sky6 security-noway" src="images/wrecks/wreck4.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter security-noway"><span>You've reported that the Scientist was killed in action.  You'll have to be careful to protect whatever improvements he managed to make.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel stone6 energy-low" src="images/lieutenant/mid-shot.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter energy-low"><span>You're not feeling optimistic about your energy supply.  You either need to do something drastic to raise it or simply try to get by without it.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel stone6 energy-medium" src="images/lieutenant/mid-shot.png"   />
<div class="vanish gutter energy-medium"><span>Your energy supply is holding up well and this is no time to be hoarding.  You should consider spending some to help your crew with their missions.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel stone6 energy-great" src="images/lieutenant/mid-shot.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter energy-great"><span>You were concerned about energy initially, but thanks to your dealings withe Zolians, you're flush.  Time to use it to help the crew accomplish their missions.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel sky6 energy-noway" src="images/mountain/engine-open.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter energy-noway"><span>With your alliance with the zolians severed, the mountain is now off limits.  You'll have to make do with whatever energy you've got left.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="section" id="morning-meeting-4">

<h2>Morning, Day Four</h2>
<div class="gutter-full">This is it, Lieutenant, the last day.  Time to assess the situation.</div>
<img class="vanish panel sky2 temple-weak" src="images/temple/temple3.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter temple-weak"><span>You haven't made much headway at the temple.  While the health benefits are apparent, the place makes you extremely suspicious.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel sky2 temple-medium" src="images/temple/temple3.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter temple-medium"><span>You've seen astonishing things at the temple, but you still feel extremely suspicious.  Could you really unlock the secret of this place?</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel sky2 temple-strong" src="images/temple/temple3.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter temple-strong"><span>After your victory at the temple you're anxious to re-connect with the Priestess.  Hopefully she's got some answers to all these mysteries.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel slate2 temple-bad" src="images/priestess/dead.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter temple-bad"><span>Last night you dreamed of the Priestess urging you to go on, saying you'd be reunited again.  Wishful thinking, you're never going back to that temple.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel stone7 temple-finished" src="images/priestess/with-devil.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter temple-finished"><span>Now that she can control the devils, the Priestess doesn't need your help anymore.  Hopefully her newfound abilities will come in handy during the final push.</span></div>

<img class="vanish panel brush2 forest-weak" src="images/forest/forest2.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter forest-weak"><span>You've had a rough go of it in the forest.  The unfamiliar terrain troubles you as does the Martian's insubordinate behaviour.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel brush2 forest-medium" src="images/forest/forest2.png"/>
<div class="vanish gutter forest-medium"><span>Events are reaching a tipping point in the forest.  The change she's undergoing may yield something even more promising, or frightening.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel brush2 forest-strong" src="images/forest/forest2.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter forest-strong"><span>Now that the Martian's transformation is complete, you're curious to see what benefits it could bring.  Only one way to find out.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel slate2 forest-bad" src="images/forest/forest8.png" />
<div class="vanish gutter forest-bad"><span>Losing the Martian is a terrible blow to morale and safety in the field.  You feel a pang of guilt and shame.  You aren't strong enough to take on the devils yourself.  At least she tried.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel brush3 forest-finished" src="images/martian/come-on.png"/>
<div class="vanish gutter forest-finished"><span>In her new purple form the Martian is probably fine without you.  You hope she doesn't lose herself out there.</span></div>
<img class="vanish panel sky2 wrecks-weak" src="images/wrecks/wreck2.png" />

For someone who's spent their life on ships and space stations, the broken, uneven paths through the temple seem unfamiliar and threatening.  It sprawls outward in every direction, a clumsy configuration of empty halls and chambers.  No discenerible plan or purpose.

<span>These hieroglyphics.  Some of them seem fresh, but there’s been no effort to preserve the older ones.  In some cases they're even covered up.</span></div>

</div>

<div class="gutter-full computer-font">My name is Lieutenant Sarah Zaldana of the scout ship Searchlight.  After five days stranded on this moon, I am the last survivor of the Searchlight's crew.  Near orbit around this moon, our ship's systems failed, all our data logs replaced with a repetitive message - "Welcome back".  Most of us were killed on impact, including the senior staff. </div>
<div class="gutter-full computer-font">I did my best to marshall the remaining crew, but we were woefully unprepared for the constant attacks by the devil creatures that wander this moon.  I ran security drills to help protect us, but their hearts weren't in it.  It's disparaging to see such fine officers give up like this. </div>
<div class="gutter-full computer-font">We all blamed ourselves.  It wasn't just the crash.  The last few  months a listless feeling has permeated our daily lives.  Out here searching for new sources of energy, finding nothing.  One empty trek after another.  The Captain had taken to running the bridge with a skeleton crew, and sometimes completely alone.  We began as disciplined officiers, but who knew that such a daring adventure could become so boring?</div>
<div class="gutter-full computer-font">The devils may have superior numbers, but their movements are very predictable, particularly during their night attacks.  Though they proved our undoing, I saw in them the same lethargy, the same lack of sponateneity I perceived in my own crewmates.  I've included detailed notes on their usual attack patterns and formations, as well as numerous suggestions on how to improve security defenses at night.  I hope you are in the company of more motivated people than I was.  It makes me smile to think that my schemes maybe useful to someone, someday.</div>

Before he set out that morning the third warrior seemed moody and apprehensive.  When I asked to go with him, he lashed out, hissing and spitting.  My aggression bile rose in my third stomach, my claws ached for a fight.  When he did not return, I felt almost relieved.  Had he come back, I felt certain we'd turn against each other, perhaps eventually kill each other.

It's strange to admit such feelings about a blood brother, but this moon is having a strange effect on me.  My other senses have sharpened to a razor's edge, but my vision has blurred.  A dark haze has fallen over me.  I can no longer tell day from night.  I'm in predatory mode all the time.  At first it seemed like a natural and useful state, but I fear I can no longer turn back.

If you have deciphered this message, you have my blessing to defend yourself in true Martian spirit.  Use the coordinates enclosed, I have buried our security net nearby.  It should help protect your own vessel from their relentless attack.  I offer it as a gesture of respect for your tenacity, and pity for your condition.  As the old Martian kings say, it is always better to live than die.  It is time for me to leave this place of death, and find a new life in the caves below.

<div class="gutter-full computer-font">
My name is Noah Bailey 17.  I am a scientist serving on the starship Valiant.  Six days ago I was assigned to a shuttle crew in order to investigate an unknown moon.  Under the grip of a strange force, we crashed here amidst thousands of other ships.  Things have gone pretty badly here.  The crew has gone off the deep end.  Two are missing and my "commanding officer" has come unhinged.
</div>
<div class="gutter-full computer-font">
I've compiled a list of all the interesting wrecks around here.  Every ship that might have something useful to fend off the devils' night attacks. I'll broadcast my secrets in the form of messages.  And if I don't miss my guess, just the right guy is going to hear them.
</div>
<div class="gutter-full computer-font">
Just before the crash, all our data banks were overwritten with a mysterious message - "welcome back".  Even though everyone said investigating was a waste of time, I knew there was something to it. To my horror, my own databanks had been rebooted several times, and my DNA was awash in several layers of neutro-chronal particles.  Evidence not only of time travel, but perpetual time travel, over and over.   
</div>
<div class="gutter-full computer-font">
I've come to believe this place is more than a trap, it's a loop.  The four of us crash, and just after we die, time rewinds itself.  We crash again and again and again, then we die again and again and again.  I can't imagine what would even create such a loop and why, but I do know how to stop it.
</div>
<div class="gutter-full computer-font">
I've included a comprehensive upgrade to the shuttle's computer.  This should help detect the night attacks a lot earlier.  Also, these are the co-ordinates to the final beacon.  It contains the secret of how to break the loop.  My test blew off the back of the ship, so obviously it's too late for me.  But I know you can do it.   Good luck, I believe in you.
